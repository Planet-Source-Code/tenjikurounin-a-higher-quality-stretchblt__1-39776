### Description

Sorry if someone has already posted something on this. I did a few searches and came up with zero results, so I figured I might as well bring this function to everyone's attention. Well anyway, this program uses the SetStretchBltMode API call to greatly improve the quality of an image resized by StretchBlt--both shrinking and stretching look much better. The code should be in the zip file. Buh-bye.
